# Automaticity-speeds-the-retrieval-of-instances-from-the-human-hippocampus
This dataset contains behavioral data, procedure code and analysis code with the manuscript "Automaticity speeds the retrieval of instances from the human hippocampus".
Data files (.mat) and associated scripts (.m) are divided into folders according to the subject of the analysis (e.g. Preprocess, TF, MVPA, Ripple etc.) .
All code is written in Matlab. 

General notes:
1)	Before running the analysis scripts, make sure you set the correct paths where the data file was extracted.
2)	To run the code, the following open-source Matlab toolboxes are required:
•	Psychtoolbox (http://www.psychtoolbox.org), version: " Psychtoolbox 3". 
	D. H. Brainard, S. Vision, The psychophysics toolbox. Spat Vis 10, 433–436 (1997).
•	EEGLAB (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php), version: "eeglab2019". 
	A. Delorme, S. Makeig, EEGLAB: An open source toolbox for analysis of single-trial EEG dynamics including independent component analysis. J. Neurosci. Methods. 134, 9-21 (2004).

3)  Data involves raw data and analyzed data.
•	Folder ‘RawData’ contains data in three brains (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, middle-temporal gyrus) after preprocessed from experiment 1.
•	Folders ‘Fig1’ to ‘Fig4’ contain all results corresponding to four figures in the paper,
